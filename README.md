# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Introduction
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a single page web application built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla javascript. This web application allows the user to play a game of "rock, paper, scissors" against a computer. There are two game play options: one with the classic fighters of "rock, paper, scissors" choices, and the other with five fighter options "rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock." The main page begins with the rules shown and allows the user to choose the game they would like to play. Then once the user chooses their fighter/weapon the game truly begins!

## Deployed Page
This application will be deployed to GitHub pages, and can be accessed soon once made public.

## Learning Goals
  - Use DRY Javascript and event delegation to handle similar event listeners
  - Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
  - Manipulate the page after loading to add, remove, and update elements on the DOM
  - Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
  - Use our problem solving process to break down large problems and solve things step by step

## Application Features
- On page load, there are two game play options: one with the classic "rock, paper, scissors" choices, and the other is more difficult with five options "rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock." The user chooses a game play option which chooses which selection of fighters are available. 
- The game is played by one user against a computer which generates a randomly selected fighter choice from the available options. The user is directed to "Choose a Fighter!" and they must select their choice.
- The winner is determined, the user choice and the computer choice fighter images are then displayed, along with a message about who won that round. The win count for the respective player is incremented and no scores are changed if the result is a draw. The win count is reset on page refresh.  
- After one round of battle is played, the user has the ability to "Change Game" from classic to more difficult to continue playing (win count doesn't reset). You can move back and forth between game types as many times as you would like. 
- A timeout is used after a completed game to reset the board to show the fighter choices to play again. 
## Possible Future Extensions
  - Set a specific number of wins for a player to reach and then restart the game score to zero wins. 
  - Implement a local storage extension where the number of wins would persist across page refreshes.
